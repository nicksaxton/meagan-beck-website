			<p id="lead">My name is Meagan Beck and I am a journalist.</p>
			<p>When I was younger, I would make fake newspapers for my parents to read with made up stories. Little did I know, what I loved doing as a hobby when I was a kid would soon become my career.</p>
			<p>My portfolio is a look at some of the best work I have produced as a reporter for The Muskegon Chronicle (MLive), editorial intern for The Grand Rapids Press (MLive) and reporter for MSU's student newspaper The State News.</p>

			<div id="about-text">
				<p>My name is Meagan and I am a 23 year old journalist from the Lansing area. In May 2016, I graduated from Michigan State University with bachelor of arts degree in journalism and a specialization in editorial reporting.</p>
				<p>I have experience with general news and breaking news reporting but my favorite style of writing is features. I enjoy writing profiles on people and places.</p>
				<p>Aside from writing, my hobbies include going to concerts, watching MSU basketball games, trying out new baking recipes and traveling.</p>
